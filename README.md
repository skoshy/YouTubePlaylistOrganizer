# YouTube Playlist Organizer

Helps you sort playlists on YouTube. Currently, it'll sort the list alphabetically by uploader, then video title.

## How do I use it?

Go to a playlist's page and there will be a new sort button you can click on.

## How do I install it?

1. Get [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or another userscript manager
2. Install via GitHub by [clicking here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skoshy/YouTubePlaylistOrganizer/master/userscript.user.js).

## Known Issues

- Currently, the script will move videos from certain music channels to the top of the list. To remedy this, in the future, there will be comprehensive sorting controls to allow fine-grained sorting.
